# Mica Shell

!!! WARNING: It's not fully functional !!!

Just a hobbie shell. You should have KWin to use it. Best way to use it starting Plasma (X11) and then use command `pkill plasmashell` and then run the compiled binary.

## Compile
Dependencies:
- Qt5
- KWindowSystem
- KWindowEffects
- KX11Extras

```mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && make```
